  <h2>Synopsis</h2>
  <p>Three Akaridions (aliens), survivors of the royal family, are forced to leave Akaridion-5, searching for a place to hide from the villains who almost killed the king and queen. They decide to hide on the planet Earth and take on forms that no one will notice. Unfortunately, the enemy knows very well where they are hiding. It is only a matter of time before the enemy tries to finish the royal family... </p>
  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p>3Below is an excellent series to watch. The action never stops with the alien refugees. Though to be quite honest, Troll Hunters is a more exciting series than this one, but if you are a true fan as I was, you will stick to the end to see how the universe of Arcadia settles its problems.  </p>
  <p>No complaints here plot-wise, though they lack a consistent crossover of this show with the previous one. However, I wish they would have included the main character in Troll Hunters with the protagonists of this story because they would have had a much better adventure together (A wise and experienced Troll Hunter fighting alongside two warriors of Akaridion-5). Also, there are a lot of plot twists that you did NOT see coming! </p>
