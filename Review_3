  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p>If you like the supernatural, then, of course, this show is for you! However, I have never felt so intrigued by the creativity of the storyline. There are so many twists and turns that you will not expect at ALL! </p>  
  <p>The creators of this show know how to take risks with their writing, and even though it is a little consistent and repetitive, you will surely never experience a dull moment! This horror/thriller sci-fi series is one of the best that I have seen in a long time!</p>
