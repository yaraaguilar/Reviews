  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p> This movie perfectly executes the backstory of a villain, making the viewer empathize with the villain. However, this movie has extreme action, so it is not recommendable for children unless you can explain a few thematic events to your child. </p>
  <p> Throughout the movie, many emotions are unpacked, both negative and positive. Overall, I had a great experience watching this movie; it made me feel thrills I havenâ€™t felt in a long time! </p>
