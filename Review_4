  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p>This show is pretty cool, and the plot is exceptionally suspenseful! ACTION, bam! ADVENTURE, boom! DETAILS, smash! All of these are included in this amazing anime. There seems to be a very great drive that each of the characters has, which eventually makes the plot advance in every possible way.  </p>
  <p>To be honest, there seems to be no end in sight for this magnificent anime. The creators did an outstanding job in creating this anime!  </p>
