  <h2>Synopsis</h2>
  <p> A teenage male, Jim Lake, has been chosen to be the next Troll Hunter. A human has never been selected to be the guardian of the Trolls, so this causes much scandal throughout the world of trolls. Jim Lake has to manage his everyday life and protect the Trolls under his city to survive. Will Jim be able to find balance and peace within himself to save the trolls from the evil that lurks in their town? Or will he be the first and last human troll hunter to exist? </p>
  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p> Troll Hunters is an excellent show for both kids and adults. It is very action-packed, but little to no violence is shown. However, some parts are exceptionally sentimental, and if you like mystery, magic, and adventure, then this show is just for you! </p>
  <p>I have no complaints about this show. The only thing that can skew this is the slow plot progression, but that is just personal preference. Other than that, the animations are smooth, and it gets fascinating. Once you start watching it, it is tough to stop. </p>
