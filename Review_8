  <p>This… this is a compilation of nursery rhymes of the YouTube channel, “CoCoMelon.”</p>
  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p>I don’t think this was intended for adults at all. If anything, parents could use it for children to entertain themselves and whatnot. It’s bizarre for an adult to watch many “Johnny Johnny Yes Papa” spin-offs, but I guess you should do what floats your boat? Anywho, this is popular because of the parents that need some me-time.</p>
