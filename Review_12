  <h2>Synopsis</h2>
  <p>A teenage girl, Marinette Dupain-Cheng, is chosen to be the holder of a magical jewel, making her a superheroine of creation. But, unfortunately, she cannot tell anyone of her identity, making it hard for her to live her life as a teen.  </p>
  <p>At the same time, a teenage model- Adrien Agreste, of the same age as Marinette, is chosen to be the holder of the jewel of destruction. He is also not permitted to tell anyone his secret identity. </p>
  <p>The two heroes work together to defeat a villain with a jewel that can control his opponents depending on their emotions.</p>
  <p>Adrien is in love with Marinette’s secret identity, the heroine. Marinette is in love with Adrien, his usual self, not knowing he is also in love with her when they’re superheroes. </p>
  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p>This is a complicated love story, and the tension between the two lovers drives the story. Unfortunately, the plot barely has any progression throughout the whole series, and most of the episodes are poorly written, which is why it only has 3 out of 5 stars. Still, overall the show has an excellent direction for the future. </p>
  <p>To be quite honest, the characters are not well written. This show should be taken lightly, as a comfort show. When I am writing this, season four is just coming out, and it is currently not on Netflix. Miraculous has a bright future with the next few seasons! </p>
