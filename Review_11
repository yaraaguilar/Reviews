  <h2>Synopsis</h2>
  <p>This series combines all of the previous series into one, making it even more exciting than before. A wizard teams up with the Guardians of Arcadia to try and save the world from destruction. First, they have to finish a war that has been going on for centuries, but unfortunately, they get sent back in time. So now they have to stop themselves from mingling with the past to make sure they can return to their designated future. </p>
  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p> Wizards of Arcadia is in the same universe as Troll Hunters and 3 Below, as they are all created by Guillermo del Toro. However, this show follows a different mystery with some familiar characters from the previous shows, so it is highly encouraged for you to watch Troll Hunters and 3 Below before this exciting series.</p>
  <p>I honestly wish there were more seasons to this exciting franchise, but alas, the world of Arcadia has ceased to have any more troubles to talk about. </p>
